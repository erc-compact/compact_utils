Key to columns:
(1) Cluster identification number
(2,3) Right ascension (hms) and declination (hms) (J2000)
(4,5) Right ascension (deg) and declination (deg) (J2000)
(6,7) Galactic longitude (Gl) and latitude (Gb) in degrees
(8,9) Gamma & gamma (Vivek please fill what they mean and units)
(10) Core radius in arcminutes from Harris Catalog

(15) Core radius in parsec from Baumgardt Catalog
(16) Half-light radius in parsec from Baumgardt Catalog
(17) Half-mass radius in parsec from Baumgardt Catalog
(18) Distance to GC from Sun (kiloparsecs) Harris Catalog

(20) Rise time UTC for 20 deg elevation at MeerKAT
(21) Set time UTC for 20 deg elevation at MeerKAT
(22) Rise time UTC for 50 deg elevation at MeerKAT
(23) Set time UTC for 50 deg elevation at MeerKAT
(24) Rise time LST for 20 deg elevation at MeerKAT
(25) Set time LST for 20 deg elevation at MeerKAT
(26) Rise time LST for 50 deg elevation at MeerKAT

(28) Mosaic UTC to generate beam tiling # Rise time UTC at 20 deg + 20 mins
(29) Is Cluster Core-Collapsed? 1 - Yes, 0 - No

# Remember source is between 20-50 deg elevation between Rise_time_sidereal_20_deg and Rise_time_sidereal_50_deg
# or Set_time_sidereal_50_deg and Set_time_sidereal_20_deg. Also take into account Tobs when scheduling.
